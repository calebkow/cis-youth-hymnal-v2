    <div class="lyrics"><p><strong>Verse 1</strong><br>
Did you ever talk to God above?<br>
Tell Him that you need a friend to love?<br>
Pray in Jesus’ name believing<br>
That God answers prayer.<br>
Have you told Him all your cares and woes?<br>
Every tiny little fear He knows.<br>
You can know He’ll always hear and<br>
He will answer prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
You can whisper in a crowd to Him.<br>
You can cry when you’re alone to Him<br>
You don’t have to pray out loud to Him;<br>
He knows your thoughts.<br>
On a lofty mountain peak, He’s there.<br>
In a meadow by a stream, He’s there.<br>
Anywhere on earth you go<br>
He’s been there from the start.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2</strong><br>
Did you ever talk to God above?<br>
Tell Him that you need a friend to love?<br>
Pray in Jesus’ name believing<br>
That God answers prayer.<br>
Find the answer in His word, it’s true.<br>
You’ll be strong because He walks with you.<br>
By His faithfulness He’ll change you, too;<br>
God answers prayer.<br>
<strong>(Fine)</strong></p>
