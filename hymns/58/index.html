    <div class="lyrics"><p><strong>Verse 1</strong><br>
I don’t know about tomorrow,<br>
I just live from day to day;<br>
I don’t borrow from its sunshine,<br>
For its skies may turn to gray;<br>
I don’t worry o’er the future,<br>
For I know what Jesus said,<br>
And today I’ll walk beside Him,<br>
For He knows what is ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
Many things about tomorrow<br>
I don’t seem to understand;<br>
But I know who holds tomorrow,<br>
And I know who holds my hand.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2</strong><br>
I don’t know about tomorrow,<br>
It may bring me poverty;<br>
But the One who feeds the sparrow,<br>
Is the One who stands by me.<br>
And the path that be my portion,<br>
May be through the flame or flood,<br>
But His presence goes before me,<br>
And I’m covered with His blood.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 3</strong><br>
Every step is getting brighter<br>
As the golden stairs I climb;<br>
Every burden’s getting lighter,<br>
Every cloud is silver lined.<br>
There the sun is always shining,<br>
There no tear will dim the eye;<br>
At the ending of the rainbow,<br>
Where the mountains touch the sky.</p>
