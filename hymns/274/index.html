    <div class="lyrics"><p><strong>Verse 1</strong><br>
Come ye beloved of the Lord<br>
And consider all the love<br>
That the Father has poured out on you.<br>
With joyful hearts in one accord<br>
Come and look upon the love<br>
Of the One who gave His all for you.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
Our God withheld not His own Son,<br>
The treasure of His heart,<br>
Poured out for you.<br>
Since He already gave His Son,<br>
What now will He withhold<br>
From you, His own?</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2</strong><br>
My friend, consider then the price<br>
That so willingly He paid<br>
To redeem and win you back to Him.<br>
Consider how then you will live<br>
And just how to spend the days<br>
And the freedom He has won for you.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 3</strong><br>
With all the treasures of His throne<br>
Of the earth, and of the sky<br>
And of the universe beyond,<br>
Our Father gave instead His Son<br>
Counting His worth far beyond<br>
All the treasures of His Kingdom home.</p>
