Above all powers, above all kings,
Above all nature, and all created things;
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man, You were here before the world began.

Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,
Above all wonders the world has ever known;
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
There&amp;rsquo;s no way to measure what You&amp;rsquo;re worth.

when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My Comforter, my All in All,
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ Alone! Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe.</description>

      <description>Verse 1
From the time I spoke Your name
Lord, my life&amp;rsquo;s not been the same
Since I called on the only one who&amp;rsquo;d saved me.
When forsaken, in despair -
Who&amp;rsquo;d have thought that You&amp;rsquo;d be there!
Now I&amp;rsquo;ve found out, Jesus, You&amp;rsquo;re alive!
All my friends might think it&amp;rsquo;s square -
Since I touch You I don&amp;rsquo;t care -
For I&amp;rsquo;ve found You&amp;rsquo;re the only life worth living.</description>

      <description>Verse 1
There&amp;rsquo;s a life that&amp;rsquo;s deeper than our mind
With experience of man, yet so divine.
It&amp;rsquo;s a life that knows no bounds;
And with glory is crowned;
It&amp;rsquo;s of depth and height and breadth unsearchable.
Now this life is just the living one
Manifested in the Person of the Son.
As the Spirit, He flows;
In our spirit He grows,
Growing up to be the Church that He desires.</description>
