      <description>Verse 1
In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
Firm through the fercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My Comforter, my All in All,
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
Verse 2
In Christ Alone! Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe.</description>
