Above all wonders the world has ever known;
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
There&amp;rsquo;s no way to measure what You&amp;rsquo;re worth.

On eagle’s wings.

My strength is restored.
Fix my eyes on You Jesus,
As I run this race.</description>

      <description>Verse 1
I don’t know about tomorrow,
I just live from day to day;

For its skies may turn to gray;
I don’t worry o’er the future,
For I know what Jesus said,
And today I’ll walk beside Him,
For He knows what is ahead.
Chorus
Many things about tomorrow
I don’t seem to understand;
But I know who holds tomorrow,
And I know who holds my hand.</description>

Here in the love of Christ I stand.

Fullness of God in helpless babe.</description>

From the time I spoke Your name
Lord, my life&amp;rsquo;s not been the same
Since I called on the only one who&amp;rsquo;d saved me.
When forsaken, in despair -
Who&amp;rsquo;d have thought that You&amp;rsquo;d be there!
Now I&amp;rsquo;ve found out, Jesus, You&amp;rsquo;re alive!
All my friends might think it&amp;rsquo;s square -
Since I touch You I don&amp;rsquo;t care -
For I&amp;rsquo;ve found You&amp;rsquo;re the only life worth living.</description>

      <description>Verse 1
There&amp;rsquo;s a life that&amp;rsquo;s deeper than our mind
With experience of man, yet so divine.
It&amp;rsquo;s a life that knows no bounds;
And with glory is crowned;
It&amp;rsquo;s of depth and height and breadth unsearchable.
Now this life is just the living one
Manifested in the Person of the Son.
As the Spirit, He flows;
In our spirit He grows,
Growing up to be the Church that He desires.</description>

      <description>Verse 1
Our God is far greater than words can make known.
Exalted and Holy, He reigns on His throne,
In infinite splendor He rules over all.
Yet He feeds the poor sparrows,
and He knows when they fall.
Chorus
His power is great and will ever endure.
His wisdom is peaceable, gentle and pure.
But greater than all these glories I see,
Is the glorious promise that He cares for me.</description>

I thank You, Lord,
For the trials that come my way,
In that way I can grow each day,
As I let You lead;
And I thank You Lord,
For the patience those trials bring,
In the process of growing, I can learn to care.
Chorus
But it goes against the way I am,
To put my human nature down,
And let the Spirit take control, of all I do;</description>

      <description>Verse 1
How can I say thanks
For the things You have done for me -
Things so undeserved,

Could not express my gratitude -
All that I am and ever hope to be,
I owe it all to Thee.
Refrain
To God be the glory,
To God be the glory;
To God be the glory</description>
