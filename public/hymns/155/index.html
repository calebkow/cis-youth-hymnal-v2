  <div class="lyrics"><p><strong>Verse 1</strong><br>
How can I say thanks<br>
For the things You have done for me -<br>
Things so undeserved,<br>
Yet You give to prove Your love for me?<br>
The voices of a million angels<br>
Could not express my gratitude -<br>
All that I am and ever hope to be,<br>
I owe it all to Thee.</p>
<p><strong>Refrain</strong><br>
To God be the glory,<br>
To God be the glory;<br>
To God be the glory<br>
For the things He has done.<br>
With His blood He has saved me;<br>
With His pow’r He has raised me;<br>
To God be the glory<br>
For the things He has done.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2</strong><br>
Just let me live my life;<br>
Let it be pleasing, Lord, to Thee.<br>
And should I gain any praise,<br>
Let it go to Calvary.</p>
<p><strong>Refrain</strong><br>
With His blood He has saved me;<br>
With His pow’r He has raised me;<br>
To God be the glory<br>
For the things He has done</p>
