  <div class="lyrics"><p><strong>Verse 1</strong><br>
There&rsquo;s a life that&rsquo;s deeper than our mind<br>
With experience of man, yet so divine.<br>
It&rsquo;s a life that knows no bounds;<br>
And with glory is crowned;<br>
It&rsquo;s of depth and height and breadth unsearchable.<br>
Now this life is just the living one<br>
Manifested in the Person of the Son.<br>
As the Spirit, He flows;<br>
In our spirit He grows,<br>
Growing up to be the Church that He desires.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
O Lord, we&rsquo;re just for Your flowing;<br>
How we need a deeper knowing!<br>
Life is why we&rsquo;re here<br>
And why You&rsquo;ve come in us.<br>
Turn us, Lord, turn us now;<br>
Turn us deeply - life is how<br>
You will get the Church,<br>
The home You&rsquo;re longing for.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2</strong><br>
In the Church, we all can apprehend<br>
All the riches of this life that is within.<br>
Not just shallowness with strife,<br>
But a deep and peaceful life,<br>
Is just waiting to flow out, a living spring.<br>
With the saints it&rsquo;s easy to be bold,<br>
To pursue this life, to gain it, to lay hold.<br>
All the other things we find,<br>
Must be quickly left behind,<br>
So that only life remains for us to see.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 3</strong><br>
Deeper, Lord, our turn must be to You;<br>
We would move by life in everything we do:<br>
All our concept refute,<br>
For Your life be absolute -<br>
Grant us grace to turn much deeper day by day.<br>
When we touch our spirit - such a thrill!<br>
This is far beyond emotion, mind and will<br>
It&rsquo;s within our hidden part.<br>
Come, make home in all our heart;<br>
Let Your presence flow as rivers deep within.</p>
