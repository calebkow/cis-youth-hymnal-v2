  <div class="lyrics"><p><strong>Verse 1</strong><br>
Our God is far greater than words can make known.<br>
Exalted and Holy, He reigns on His throne,<br>
In infinite splendor He rules over all.<br>
Yet He feeds the poor sparrows,<br>
and He knows when they fall.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
His power is great and will ever endure.<br>
His wisdom is peaceable, gentle and pure.<br>
But greater than all these glories I see,<br>
Is the glorious promise that He cares for me.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2</strong><br>
He rides the wild heavens, He strides to the sea.<br>
The high mountain trembles to hear His decree.<br>
His voice with great thundering sounds from above.<br>
But to His own dear children, He whispers His love</p>
<p><strong>(Chorus)</strong></p>
