      <description>Chorus
A common love for each other,
A common gift to the Savior,
A common bond holding us to the Lord.
A common strength when we’re weary,
A common hope for tomorrow,
A common joy in the truth of God’s Word.
Verse 1
In His family, we can meet each one’s needs,
We can light each one’s path,
We can bear each one’s grief.
As His children,
We can comfort each care,</description>

Who once was slain
To reconcile man to God

Ancient words will guide us home.

Ancient words, ever true
Changing me and changing you
We have come with open hearts
Oh let the ancient words impart.</description>

      <description>Verse 1
I’m singing for my Lord
Everywhere I go,
Singing of His wondrous love
That the world may know
How He saved a wretch like me
By His death on Calvary -
I’m singing for my Lord
Everywhere I go.
Verse 2
I’m singing, but sometimes
Heavy is the load
For this world is not a friend
To the grace of God;
Yet I’ll sing the whole day long,</description>

In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;

Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My Comforter, my All in All,
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
Verse 2
In Christ Alone! Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe.</description>

From the time I spoke Your name
Lord, my life&amp;rsquo;s not been the same
Since I called on the only one who&amp;rsquo;d saved me.
When forsaken, in despair -
Who&amp;rsquo;d have thought that You&amp;rsquo;d be there!
Now I&amp;rsquo;ve found out, Jesus, You&amp;rsquo;re alive!
All my friends might think it&amp;rsquo;s square -
Since I touch You I don&amp;rsquo;t care -
For I&amp;rsquo;ve found You&amp;rsquo;re the only life worth living.</description>

’Till the morning star has risen!
We would count all things loss, but Jesus gain,
Our inward parts cry out for You to reign.

There&amp;rsquo;s a life that&amp;rsquo;s deeper than our mind

And with glory is crowned;
It&amp;rsquo;s of depth and height and breadth unsearchable.
Now this life is just the living one
Manifested in the Person of the Son.
As the Spirit, He flows;
In our spirit He grows,
Growing up to be the Church that He desires.</description>

Once I thirsted for a fountain,
Something deep that would satisfy,
But the fountain that I’d drink from,
Left me searching and still so dry.
Then one day I found Him,
He satisfied my thirst,
Became in me a deeper source
Whence living waters burst.
Now I drink Him!
Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life;
I’m fully satisfied now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life.</description>

His wisdom is peaceable, gentle and pure.
But greater than all these glories I see,
Is the glorious promise that He cares for me.</description>

      <description>Verse 1
Who can stand, who can stand?
Before the anger of the LordWho can shout, who can say?
“I have no need of God”?
Who can fathom the power of His might?
The greatness of His strike,
the force of His right hand?
Who can fathom the potter’s way with His clay?
Who can stand against You Lord?
Verse 2
Do we know or understand?
The depth of the Love of God?</description>

Who shall not fear Your name, O King?
O Lord of all the earth?
For this is Your rightful due.
In all the kingdoms of the world,
The name of Jesus stands alone
For there is none like You!
Verse 2
Who shall not honour You, O King?
O Lord of all the earth?
For this is Your rightful due.
In all the kingdoms of the world,
The name of Jesus stands alone</description>

Let His little child come in.

You are the treasure that I seek,
You are my All in All. Seeking you as a precious jewel,

You are my all in all

Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is Your Name!
Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is Your Name!
Verse 2
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame,
Rising again I bless Your name.</description>
